  "description": "RuntimeContext_1DWaveform provides a context for scripts that generate and acquire 1D waveform data. This context is designed for experiments where a voltage or other parameter is swept in discrete steps, from one or more instruments. It supports configuring voltage domains, sample rates, and acquisition parameters, as well as batch operations, parallel execution, and logging. Typical use cases include time-domain measurements, pulsed experiments, and waveform acquisition synchronized with parameter sweeps.",
